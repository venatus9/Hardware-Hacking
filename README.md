# Hardware Hacking!

Hi, I'm Samuel (venatus9) Kamas - this repository is being kept for the purpose of documentation for a number of my projects that pertain to the topic of hardware hacking.

Of course, everything I have documented here has been and only ever should be used for **educational purposes only**.

With that said, happy hacking!!
